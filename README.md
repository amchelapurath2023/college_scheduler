CS 2340 Project 1

Description

This first project will help you learn and practice skills for our course main technology: Android Studio. For this purpose, you will be asked to work with peers on this first project.

The first project will have two parts: 1) the creation of your student-created tutorial to help others get into Android Studio, and 2) the design and development of an Android mobile app based on Java.

 

Privacy & Ethical Consideration 

Keep in mind that this is an assignment proposed for your learning. Ensure that you and your peers follow a process that fosters your understanding of the tool as well as granting you skills as a software developer.

 

Q/A Management

You all can use Ed Discussion and reach out to your sponsoring Teaching Assistant (TA) to address questions, doubts, and clarifications. Keep in mind that each team will end up with different concepts and development outcomes. That’s fine and expected! Play along with your teammates to ensure that your solution addresses and fulfills the expected functionality. Your sponsoring TA will serve as your client.

 

First Part: Android Reinforcement

You all have already completed, individually, your first exploration for Android Studio. For this first part, as a team and following the same tutorial (see reference: Build Your First Android App in JavaLinks to an external site.), create a better tutorial that helps a novice similar to you get started with Android Studio.

You may want to consider configuration/installation issues you may want someone else to know about ahead of time, as well as videos, screenshots, and examples that may help them complete that tutorial in a better way. We suggest you explore Ed Discussion to see common errors and questions among your peers.

Ways to test out your better tutorial: check with friends, roommates, or family members how much your explanations work!

 

Second Part: College Scheduler App

Your team has to design and build the College Scheduler App, proposed to help college students by providing a straightforward and efficient way to manage their academic schedules. This app focuses on core functionalities that allow students to track their classes, assignments, and exams. The aim is to offer a user-friendly and accessible tool that adapts to various class formats and individual schedules, helping students stay organized and focused on their academic commitments.
